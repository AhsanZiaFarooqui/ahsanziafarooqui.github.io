        <p class="pub-abstract">
          Six preregistered field experiments across the Global South tested the effects of community policing
          on citizen trust in police, willingness to report crime, and actual crime levels. The interventions
          reached approximately 9 million people across 516 treated areas in Brazil, Colombia, Liberia, Pakistan,
          the Philippines, and Uganda. Community policing did not improve citizen-police trust or reduce crime,
          suggesting that standard community policing models require complementary institutional reforms.

        <p class="pub-abstract">
          This chapter presents findings from a randomized community policing intervention conducted in Punjab, Pakistan.
          It analyzes how community forums, dispute resolution mechanisms, and police-citizen engagement affect
          trust in police and perceptions of safety. The study is part of the EGAP MetaKeta IV multi-country
          coordinated trial on community policing.

        <p class="pub-abstract">
          Studies a randomized community policing intervention in Pakistan that demonstrates the promise of
          combining segregation and integration-based approaches through creating separate spaces for women
          citizens while having male and female officers work together on integrated teams. The intervention
          increased women's attendance at community forums and raised distinctive concerns around gender-based violence.

          Examines how the transition from Annual Rental Value to Capital Value taxation in Punjab changes
