        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
         I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Sussex. I am also a Doctoral Fellow at the International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD) and the Local Government Revenue Initiative (LoGRI), and a Graduate Fellow at the Institute for Development and Economic Alternatives Pakistan (IDEAS).

        <p>
          My research sits at the intersection of public finance and state capacity, with a focus on how frontline bureaucrats’ discretion shapes policy outcomes in Pakistan. Methodologically, I combine administrative and survey data with causal inference tools including field experiments and quasi-experimental designs, and I use institutional detail to link empirical estimates to policy design. In recent years, I have led research projects on policing, national and subnational taxation (including property and excise systems), and public-school teacher recruitment. A recurring theme across these projects is testing how technology and digital public infrastructure can reduce discretionary distortions and improve citizens’ perceptions of fairness in government services.
